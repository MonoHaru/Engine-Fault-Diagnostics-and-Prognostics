# Main engine Fault Diagnostics and Progonostics using Exhaust Gas Temperature data

The early detection and management of defects in a ship's main engine are crucial for ensuring efficient and safe operation. The occurrence of defects can lead to increased economic losses and safety hazards. However, conventional diagnostic approaches are limited to addressing defects that have already occurred. This paper aims to extend defect diagnostics beyond the current timeframe by leveraging exhaust gas temperature data collected in real-world operational environments. Specifically, the study conducts simulations to diagnose potential future defects in the ship's main engine.

The research is conducted in three phases. First, various machine learning models are applied to diagnose defects at the current point in time, and the most suitable model is identified. Second, a Transformer-based model is designed to predict future time-series data, and its performance is evaluated. Finally, defect diagnostics are performed at future time points using the predicted time-series data. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves a diagnostic accuracy of 78.160% by utilizing the predicted time-series data.
